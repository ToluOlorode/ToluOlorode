## About Me

I'm Tolu Olorode (she/her), a passionate tech enthusiast with a strong interest in DevOps. I'm excited to embark on this journey to master DevOps principles and practices.
âš¡ Fun fact **I am currently self-learning Blender so that I can create Custom Content for The Sims 4**

## Goals

My primary goals as an aspiring DevOps engineer are:

- Gain proficiency in automating and streamlining software development and deployment processes.
- Learn to orchestrate and manage containerized applications using technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.
- Implement and maintain CI/CD pipelines to ensure fast and reliable software delivery.
- Develop a deep understanding of infrastructure as code (IaC) and configuration management.
- Acquire knowledge of cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or GCP.
- Continuously improve monitoring, logging, and incident response practices.

## Learning Path

To achieve my goals, I've outlined a learning path that includes:

- **Courses:** I am currently taking a Devops Engineer course with Learnwithpride to help build a strong foundation. I have also taken the Devops Beginners to Advanced with Projects on Udemy.
- **Certifications:** I aim to earn certifications such as DevOps on AWS Specialization on Coursera and AWS to validate my skills.
- **Hands-On Projects:** I'll be working on practical projects to apply what I learn and gain real-world experience.
- **Reading:** Regularly reading books, blogs, and documentation to stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in DevOps.

## Projects

I believe that hands-on experience is crucial in DevOps. Some of the projects I'm working on or planning to undertake include:

- **Project 1:** A simple Jenkins Pipeline Script -(https://github.com/ToluOlorode/Deployment-Pipeline)
- **Project 2:** A more advanced Jenkins Pipeline Script with Docker Deployment - (https://github.com/ToluOlorode/DockerPipeline.git)
- **Project 3:** Created a Jenkins CICD that prompts a manual approval before deploying to a Nginx server - (https://github.com/ToluOlorode/Jenkins_CICD)

These projects will not only enhance my skills but also serve as evidence of my progress.

## Tools

I'll be using a variety of DevOps tools and technologies, including:

- **Version Control:** Git
- **Continuous Integration:** Jenkins
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS 
- **Collaboration:** Microsoft Teams
- **Scripting:** Shell scripting, Python

## Resources

To help others who are also aspiring DevOps engineers, I'll maintain a list of valuable resources, including books, online courses, tutorials, and blog posts. Feel free to check out the [Resources](resources.md) file in this repository.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the DevOps community. If you have any insights, recommendations, or want to collaborate on a project, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
